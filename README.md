CoD4 High XP mod
=============

<b>new dvar</b>: scr_xpscale<br>
<b>range</b>: 1 - 100

Example line for the server.cfg:<br>
<b>set scr_xpscale "5"</b>

Setting the scr_xpscale value to 1 or removing the line from the server.cfg results in the default XP values.
The mod will instantly promote players on level 1 that do not have any XP in CoD4 to level 9 at this point. This feature might be subject to change in the future.
